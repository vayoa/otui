**Doujinshi Script: "The Fat Man's Revenge"**

**Warning: This script contains explicit content, mind control, and non-consensual acts. Reader discretion is advised.**

**Story Premise:**

Kazuo, a morbidly obese and socially isolated man in his late 40s, discovers an ancient tome hidden in his attic. The tome contains dark magic that grants the wielder mind control powers. Kazuo, fueled by years of resentment towards his perfect and beautiful neighbors, the Nakaharas, decides to use his newfound powers to wreak havoc on their lives.

**Chapter 1: "The Discovery"**

Page 1-2: Establish Kazuo's miserable life as a recluse, showing his dirty apartment filled with trash and takeout containers. Kazuo's obese body is a constant reminder of his poor health and lack of self-care.

Page 5-6: Kazuo, ignoring his initial hesitation, decides to open the tome. As he touches the cover, he feels an energy coursing through his body. The words on the pages begin to shift and change, revealing dark incantations that grant mind control powers.

Page 7-8: Kazuo, with a sly grin, begins to chant the incantation. A dark aura envelops his body as he feels the power coursing through his veins.

**Chapter 2: "The First Victim"**

Page 3-4: Kazuo, hiding in the shadows, observes the Nakaharas. He becomes fixated on Emily's beauty and begins to fantasize about having control over her.

Page 5-6: Kazuo decides to test his powers on Emily. He summons his dark aura and casts a mind control spell on her. Emily, suddenly finding herself under Kazuo's control, awkwardly gets up from the dinner table.

Page 7-8: Emily, now under Kazuo's control, is seen following his commands. She removes her clothes and poses for Kazuo's twisted pleasure. Kazuo revels in his newfound power and the submission of his former crush.

**Chapter 3: "The Family Fall"**

Page 5-6: Yumi, now under Kazuo's control, is forced to participate in a twisted experiment. Kazuo combines mind control and humiliation to break the strong bond between Yumi and her husband.

Page 7-8: Emily's father, Shinji, realizing his family is under some sort of mind control, tries to resist. However, Kazuo is too powerful, and he also falls under his control.

**Chapter 4: "The Fat Man's Revenge"**

Page 1-2: Kazuo revels in his newfound control over the Nakahara family. He forces them to perform grotesque acts, including the father, Shinji, having non-consensual sex with his own daughter Emily.

This is the basic structure of the doujinshi script.
